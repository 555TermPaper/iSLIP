5. param.dat file contains parameters like %throughput, average delay and total delay against load. 
  The graphs are ploted using this .dat file using gnuplot.
6. queueLen.dat file contains the length of queues after every timeslot
7. avg_queueLen.dat file contains the time average queue length after evry time slot.
